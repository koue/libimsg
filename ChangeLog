	  Unsigned overflows are not a bug in C but we have to make sure
	  that requested buffer sizes will be actually available.

	* lib/libutil/: imsg-buffer.c, imsg.c: Use freezero(3) for the imsg
	  framework in imsg_free(3) and ibuf_free(3).

	  In our privsep model, imsg is often used to transport sensitive
	  information between processes.  But a process might free an imsg,
	  and reuse the memory for a different thing.  iked uses some
	  explicit_bzero() to clean imsg-buffer but doing it in the library
	  with the freezero() is less error-prone and also benefits other
	  daemons.

	* lib/libutil/: imsg.c, imsg.h, imsg_init.3: Use C99 types

	  No objections from millert@.

	  violations would be needed to resolve this issue otherwise.

	  application may provide a reserve count to ensure that the
	  recvmsg() call is not called when they don't have enough
	  descriptors to work properly.

	  change the API so that transient errors that can be retried
	  immediately are retried within the function right away, whereas
	  transient errors for which the application may want to take
	  action will set errno to EAGAIN.
